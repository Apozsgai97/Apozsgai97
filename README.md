## About Me :smile:
Hi, I’m Adrienn Pozsgai! I’m a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer based in Stockholm, Sweden. I love building accessible and user-friendly applications that make a difference. Before diving into tech, I worked in special education, which gave me a lot of experience working with people, solving problems creatively, and staying flexible in different situations. I enjoy learning new things, whether it’s about technology, teamwork, or just finding better ways to do things.
